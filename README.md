# CS_215_Final_Project_Amusement_Park

#This project simulates a typical day at an amusement park that creates people with random names from a hash map and enters them into a bag from where they will be added to one of the lines of several different types of rides with each ride operating for a given amount of time steps at which point the current riders that were on the ride (stored in the ride queue) exit the ride and are entered into the bag that contains people while the next people in the queue are entered into the ride. There is a random chance that a rider is created with the last name "Fastman" which will have a fastPass value of 1 that will immediately bring them to the front of the ride queue. Each time a rider exits a ride, their ride counter will increase and they will leave the park after their ride counter reaches 5.
